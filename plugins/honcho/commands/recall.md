# Recall from Memory

Search Honcho's persistent memory for information from past sessions.

Use the `search` MCP tool to find relevant past interactions, then summarize what was found.

If the user provides a topic after `/recall`, search for that topic. If no topic is provided, ask what they'd like to recall.

Present results concisely with timestamps and session context where available.
