# Honcho Configuration

Interactive configuration for the Honcho memory plugin. Uses AskUserQuestion for all menus and selections — never dump numbered text lists.

## Step 1: Status Header

Call `get_config` to load the current state. The response includes a `card` field — a pre-rendered box-drawing card with perfect alignment.

**Output the `card` value exactly as-is inside a code fence.** Do not modify it, re-render it, or add any formatting. Just wrap it in triple backticks:

````
```
{card value here, verbatim}
```
````
- Do NOT show cache info, config paths, or raw JSON.
- Do NOT show warnings unless they indicate something is broken (skip env var shadowing warnings where the values match what's configured).
- If `configExists` is false, tell the user no config exists and offer to create one.

## Step 2: Menu

Use `AskUserQuestion` with two questions to present the menu. First question selects the category, second selects the specific setting.

Present ONE question with these options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to configure?"
  header: "Config"
  options:
    - label: "Current session"
      description: "Switch or rename the active session (currently: {current.session})"
    - label: "Peers"
      description: "Your name and AI name (currently: {resolved.peerName} / {resolved.aiPeer})"
    - label: "Session mapping"
      description: "How sessions are named — per directory, git branch, or per chat (currently: {resolved.sessionStrategy})"
    - label: "Workspace"
      description: "Data space, linking, and cross-tool context (currently: {resolved.workspace})"
```

If the user selects "Other", present advanced options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Advanced settings:"
  header: "Advanced"
  options:
    - label: "Host"
      description: "Platform / local / custom URL (currently: {current.host})"
    - label: "Context refresh"
      description: "TTL, message threshold, dialectic settings"
    - label: "Message upload"
      description: "Token limits, summarization settings"
```

Always include current values in the description so the user can see what's set.

## Step 3: Handle Selection

### Peers

When selected, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which peer to change:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which peer to change?"
  header: "Peers"
  options:
    - label: "Your name"
      description: "Currently: {resolved.peerName}"
    - label: "AI name"
      description: "Currently: {resolved.aiPeer}"
```

Then ask for the new value. Call `set_config` with `peerName` or `aiPeer`.

### Simple fields (Logging, etc.)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask for the new value if there are known options, otherwise ask the user to type it. Call `set_config` with the appropriate field. Show the result.

### Current session

The `get_config` response includes `current.session` (the resolved name) and `current.cwd` (the directory it was resolved from). Always use `current.cwd` as the `path` when calling `sessions.set` or `sessions.remove`.

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Session '{current.session}' — what would you like to do?"
  header: "Session"
  options:
    - label: "Rename / switch"
      description: "Set a different session name for this directory"
    - label: "Reset to default"
      description: "Remove override, revert to computed name"
```

**If "Rename / switch":** Ask for the new session name. Explain that if the name matches an existing Honcho session, the user will reconnect to its history; if it's new, a fresh session starts. The old session is not deleted — they can switch back.

Call `set_config` with `field: "sessions.set"` and `value: { path: "{current.cwd}", name: "{userInput}" }`.

**If "Reset to default":** Call `set_config` with `field: "sessions.remove"` and `value: { path: "{current.cwd}" }`. Show the new computed session name from the refreshed `get_config`.

Note: Rename/switch only applies to `per-directory` strategy. If the current strategy is `git-branch` or `chat-instance`, tell the user that session names are derived dynamically and cannot be overridden — suggest switching to `per-directory` strategy first.

### Session mapping

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which session mapping strategy?"
  header: "Sessions"
  options:
    - label: "per-directory (Recommended)"
      description: "{peer}-{repo} — one session per project"
    - label: "git-branch"
      description: "{peer}-{repo}-{branch} — session follows branch"
    - label: "chat-instance"
      description: "chat-{id} — fresh each launch"
```

Do NOT use markdown previews for this menu — descriptions are sufficient and previews truncate in narrow terminals.

After strategy selection, ask about peer prefix:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Include your name in session names?"
  header: "Prefix"
  options:
    - label: "Yes — {peerName}-{repoName}"
      description: "For teams sharing a workspace"
    - label: "No — {repoName} only"
      description: "Cleaner for solo use"
```

### Workspace

When selected, present a sub-menu:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Workspace settings?"
  header: "Workspace"
  options:
    - label: "Rename workspace"
      description: "Change workspace name (currently: {resolved.workspace})"
    - label: "Link / unlink hosts"
      description: "Share context across tools (currently: {resolved.linkedHosts || 'none'})"
```

#### Workspace > Rename

Dangerous field — requires confirmation. First call `set_config` WITHOUT `confirm: true`. The tool will return a description of what will happen. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Switch workspace to '{value}'?"
  header: "Confirm"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, switch"
      description: "Change to the new workspace"
    - label: "Cancel"
      description: "Keep current workspace"
```

If confirmed, call `set_config` again WITH `confirm: true`.

#### Workspace > Link / unlink hosts

Linking and global mode are one concept: if any hosts are linked, global mode is on (shared workspace, sessions, peers). If all hosts are unlinked, global mode is off.

Show one option per host. Each option is either "Link {host}" or "Unlink {host}" depending on current state. Do NOT use multiSelect — use single-select so only one action happens at a time.

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Link or unlink a host:"
  header: "Link"
  options:
    - label: "Unlink {hostKey}"              // for each host in resolved.linkedHosts
      description: "Currently linked (workspace: {hostWorkspace})"
    - label: "Link {hostKey}"                // for each host NOT in resolved.linkedHosts
      description: "workspace: {hostWorkspace}"
    (one option per host from get_config's host.otherHosts)
```

**If the user chose "Link {host}":**

Compute the new linked array: current `resolved.linkedHosts` + the new host.
Call `set_config` with `field: "linkedHosts"` and the new array.

If this is the first link (was previously empty), prompt for shared workspace:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Shared workspace name?"
  header: "Workspace"
  options:
    - label: "{currentWorkspace} (Recommended)"
      description: "Keep the current workspace"
    - label: "{otherHostWorkspace}"
      description: "Use {otherHost}'s workspace"
    (one option per unique workspace among linked hosts + current host)
```

Call `set_config` with `field: "workspace"`, `value: chosen`, `confirm: true`.
Call `set_config` with `field: "globalOverride"`, `value: true`, `confirm: true`.

If already linked to other hosts (just adding one more), skip the workspace prompt — the shared workspace is already set.

**If the user chose "Unlink {host}":**

Compute the new linked array: current `resolved.linkedHosts` minus that host.
Call `set_config` with `field: "linkedHosts"` and the new array.

If the new array is empty (no hosts linked), also disable global mode:
Call `set_config` with `field: "globalOverride"`, `value: false`.
Explain: "All hosts unlinked. Each host uses its own workspace and config."

If hosts remain linked, just confirm: "Unlinked {host}. Still linked to: {remaining}."

### Dangerous fields (Host)

Host changes require confirmation. First call `set_config` WITHOUT `confirm: true`. The tool will return a description of what will happen. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm, then call again WITH `confirm: true`.

### Context refresh

Use `AskUserQuestion` to pick which setting to change:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which context refresh setting?"
  header: "Refresh"
  options:
    - label: "TTL"
      description: "Cache lifetime — currently {contextRefresh.ttlSeconds}s (default: 300)"
    - label: "Message threshold"
      description: "Refresh every N messages — currently {contextRefresh.messageThreshold} (default: 30)"
    - label: "Skip dialectic"
      description: "Skip chat() in prompt hook — currently {contextRefresh.skipDialectic} (default: false)"
```

Then ask for the new value and call `set_config`.

### Message upload

Use `AskUserQuestion` to pick which setting to change:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which message upload setting?"
  header: "Upload"
  options:
    - label: "Max user tokens"
      description: "Truncate user messages — currently {messageUpload.maxUserTokens || 'no limit'}"
    - label: "Max assistant tokens"
      description: "Truncate assistant messages — currently {messageUpload.maxAssistantTokens || 'no limit'}"
    - label: "Summarize assistant"
      description: "Use summary instead of full text — currently {messageUpload.summarizeAssistant}"
```

Then ask for the new value and call `set_config`.

## Step 4: Loop

After handling a selection, call `get_config` again to refresh state. Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask if they want to configure more:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Configuration updated. What next?"
  header: "Next"
  options:
    - label: "Configure more"
      description: "Return to settings menu"
    - label: "Done"
      description: "Exit configuration"
```

If "Configure more", go back to Step 2. If "Done", show the final status header and exit.

## Guardrails

- ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion for menus and confirmations. Never present numbered text lists.
- Always show the result of `set_config` including any cache invalidation that occurred.
- If a warning about env var shadowing is returned, explain that the env var takes precedence at runtime.
- Never guess values — always ask the user.
- Include current values in option descriptions so the user sees what's set without expanding anything.
- If `get_config` returns `configExists: false`, guide the user to set HONCHO_API_KEY first.
